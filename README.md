# Autonomous quadcopter software
This software is supposed to let any quadcopter mounted with Android smart-phone and Arduino be an autonomous quadcopter capable of tracking any object (anything like moving cars, people etc) using image processing. Please consider reading the documentation and you are requested to contact the developer in case of discrepancies.

The documentation enlists the architecture, works which have been completed and further scope of the project. The current version is 0 (alpha) as there has to be (more) intensive testing for the softwares that is being developed (which shall soon be released as beta version).
